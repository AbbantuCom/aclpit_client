  title: 'An institution built for a defining challenge of this decade',
  paragraph1:
    "Africa's rapid digitalisation is reshaping economies and societies faster than the legal frameworks meant to govern them. ACLPIT was conceived to close that gap: an independent, Africa rooted centre that combines rigorous legal expertise with a genuine understanding of technology.",
  paragraph2:
    'We bridge the divide between policymakers, technologists, regulators and the communities affected by digital transformation, so that law becomes a tool not only for managing risk but for enabling responsible innovation and protecting fundamental rights, particularly for underserved and vulnerable communities.',

  backgroundTitle: 'Born from a gap, built for an opportunity',
  backgroundParagraph1:
    'Mobile money, digital identity systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain and e governance platforms are reshaping African economies and societies at a pace that has outstripped the legal and regulatory frameworks meant to govern them.',
  backgroundParagraph2:
    'That gap creates real risks: unresolved data protection questions, weak consumer and digital rights protections, uneven access to justice, and regulation that struggles to keep pace with innovation. But it also presents an opportunity. Law can be a tool not only for managing risk, but for enabling responsible innovation, protecting the public interest and ensuring the benefits of technology are equitably distributed.',
  backgroundParagraph3:
    'Realising that opportunity requires an institution that combines rigorous legal expertise with a genuine understanding of technology. The African Centre for Law and Public Interest Technology is conceived as that institution.',
